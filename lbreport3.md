* Which methods in your code are called?
  main method, server.start(),hanldeRequst()

* What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?
***
for main method it need a int input for port number.
for server.start, it needs portNumber and a new Handler.
for HandleRequest it needs a uri as a argument and Stringbuilder called mess.

* How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.
***
the value of stringbuilder is changed if the uri read from the browser has "/add-message?s" and it will add the string information after that.

# Part 2

*A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)

*An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
*The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
*The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
